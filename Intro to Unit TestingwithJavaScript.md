### What is your understanding of why testing is important?

Testing allows you to document changes, fix problems before they affect users, and simplify code and function.



### Explain the steps of TDD in your own words.

1. Write out basic skeleton of what you want your code to do.

2. Test parts of the code until they pass.

3. Test all parts of the code altogether, including old unchanged code that worked initially, to insure they all pass as a whole.

4. Improve the code where needed.
