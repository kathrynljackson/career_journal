Week 4: 

- [x] (completed)
- [ ] (partially complete)
- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you’ll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track):

1. Prepare for Job Shadow: AEIOU
- Activities: what questions do you have about the activities that a software developer does on a daily basis?
   - How do you know what do do next? How is the workflow documented?
- Environment: what questions do you have about the overall environment and culture of this workplace?
   - Are employees happy to be there every day?
   - What is the dress code?
   - Does the compnay actively make space for the underrepresented?
- Interactions: what questions do you have about the team at this company? What do you hope to see in your interactions during the shadow?
   - How often are you working alone vs. working alongside another person?
   - Are goals set based on team achievement or individual achievement?
- Objects: what questions do you have about the code or the product?
   - How is the code tested?
   - Who approves changes?
- Users: what questions do you have about how the company interacts with their users?
   - How easy is it for a user to contact your company and get a response in a timely manner?


2. After the Job Shadow, reflect on the same questions; what are your takeaways from the shadow?
- Activities: what was engaging to the person/people you shadowed?
   - I love the way he answered our questions with information, experience explanations, and examples. 
- Environment: what did you notice about how they talked about the culture and environment of this company?
   - He compared his current environment to his past work environment. While he spoke professionally of both, he gave lots of concrete reasons why he left that company and came to this one. Listening to his experience gave me a lot of standards that I want to set for myself during the job hunt. 
- Interactions: what did you notice about your interactions with this person/people?
   - This person talked about his collegues in a professional manner. He also was glad to answer any questions we had, showing that he is probably very good at collaborating with junior devs. 
- Objects: what did you learn about their approach to code and/or product development?
   - It's okay to ask for help and it's okay to take on an easy task!
- Users: what did you learn about their approach to their users?
   - Being a front-end developer requires A LOT of research on non-coding topics such as colloquial language and disabilities. 
- What are your main takeaways from the shadow? How will you use this information to help you with your job search strategy?
   - It's okay to be picky when looking for a job. Being in a comfortable environment will make you a better developer who has the mental capacity to learn new skills.
   
   
3. Interview Prep:
- Pick a successful project and write about it with the STAR method (What was the situation/scenario of the project? What was the task/target of the project? What action steps did you take? What were the results?):
   - We were given a project where the task was to show understanding of React, Routing, and persisting data.
   - My responsibility was to create an app that showed mastery of the skills above, as well as to be able to test them and make the usage accessible and easy to use.
   - I created an app that assists Pokémon gamers in creating a strategy to defeat each opponent.
   - I learned that our skills as developers can be applied in countless ways in almost any field. 
- Write about a time you failed and what you learned from that experience:
   - Mod 1 first project
   - I learned that failure can be used as a tool to measure your level of understanding, giving you an accurate starting point to learn something new at an efficient pace. 
- Write about how you’ve approached working with a team using a specific example:
   - Successful teamwork centers around good communication. Every projet should start with a conversation. 
- What other stories will you prepare to share?
   - How I became better at teamwork. 
- Do some research into your top companies’ tech stacks; what do you already know? What can you compare to your own learning? What do you need to learn more about?
   - I want to learn more about Discovery Education's size and how Education department works with the other departments.
