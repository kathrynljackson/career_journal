If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you’ll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track):

1. Prepare for Job Shadow: AEIOU
   - Activities: what questions do you have about the activities that a software developer does on a daily basis?
   - Environment: what questions do you have about the overall environment and culture of this workplace?
   - Interactions: what questions do you have about the team at this company? What do you hope to see in your interactions during the shadow?
   - Objects: what questions do you have about the code or the product?
   - Users: what questions do you have about how the company interacts with their users?
2. After the Job Shadow, reflect on the same questions; what are your takeaways from the shadow?
   - Activities: what was engaging to the person/people you shadowed?
   - Environment: what did you notice about how they talked about the culture and environment of this company?
   - Interactions: what did you notice about your interactions with this person/people?
   - Objects: what did you learn about their approach to code and/or product development?
   - Users: what did you learn about their approach to their users?
   - What are your main takeaways from the shadow? How will you use this information to help you with your job search strategy?
3. Interview Prep:
   - Pick a successful project and write about it with the STAR method (What was the situation/scenario of the project? What was the task/target of the project? What action steps did you take? What were the results?):
   - Write about a time you failed and what you learned from that experience:
   - Write about how you’ve approached working with a team using a specific example:
   - What other stories will you prepare to share?
   - Do some research into your top companies’ tech stacks; what do you already know? What can you compare to your own learning? What do you need to learn more about?
