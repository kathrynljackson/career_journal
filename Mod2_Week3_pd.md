- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you'll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track): 


### 1. Assess your habits from week 2: how did you spend your time this past week? What was effective in your habits? What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen? **

### 2. Reflect on how youâ€™ve spent your time so far at Turing to gauge your engagement and energy:

**When have you been excited, focused, and enjoyed your work?**

I get most excited when I feel like I am making measureable progress.

**When have you felt bored, restless, or unhappy?**

I tend to get bored when I'm either not performing an action or when the content being taught is currently too hard for me to mentally apply to my background knowledge. 

**When do you feel energized in your work?**

I feel energized when there is success based on my effort, understanding, or deliverable work.

**When is your energy drained?**

My energy is drained when I spend a lot of time and make no progress.

### 3. Setting up habits and routines to make time for the job search this module:

* Block out time on your calendar this week to work on your job search. When will you make this happen? How will you hold yourself accountable to this? What activities will you focus on during this time this week? What outcomes do you hope to reach by the end of this week because of these activities?

### 4. Applying wayfinding to using job search resources

* Go through the resources [listed here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/resources/finding_opportunities.md) and explore 2-3 tools. List what you looked at here:

* Apply wayfinding: of what you looked at, what did you discover that aligns with your vision? If it didn't align with your vision, what will you try next? Decide what tools to bookmark to explore later. 

* Find a job posting that aligns with your vision. What's the posting? How does it align with what you're looking for? Add it to your Huntr.

* What next steps will you take to explore that opportunity and find contacts? Add that information to your Huntr card.
