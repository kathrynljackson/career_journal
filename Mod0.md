## 1. When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?

Whenever I work towards a goal, I focus on the logical reasoning as to why I should complete the goal. If it is a **want**, 
working towards the goal comes naturally. If the goal involves a **need**, then there's a chance that the process
will not be fun. In cases like these, I remind myself why I logically need to complete that goal. Reasons may include 
education, quality of life, or effect on others. While at Turing, I predict that I will enjoy most of the assignments 
based on how I have enjoyed them so far during Mod0. There will inecvitably be an instance in which the assignemnt 
may not appeal to my interests. In this case, I would focus on the outcome: working hard throughout my programming 
education will allow me to have the job that I want and be able to complete tasks at work easily. I will also be 
able to help my classmates, making them more willing to help me.


## 2. As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?

One of my strengths is my compulsive need to solve problems that I think I'm capable of solving. If a teacher gives me 
an assignment, then I should be able to solve whatever problems they involve. This makes me incredibly persistant. Another 
strength is my ability to research topics. My previous job requred me to teach colleagues about new technology as well as assist them with any prblems they were having. I often had to reach out to friends and use the internet to help the people
that needed me. I was usually successful and was even able to show my coworkers different techniques to find answers 
to other questions.


## 3.Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):

I work best in a quiet environment. I have sensory processing disorder so many environments that most people would deem 
normal are chaotic to me. I have learned to use different tactics that make it easier for me to work without affecting 
the people around me. For instance, I use noise isolating headphones. I do not play sound on them while I work, so the noise arround me is dampened. This allows me to concentrate better, remain calm, and prevents me from accidentally ignoring the people around me due to complete noise cancellation or loud volumes that may come from playing audio.
