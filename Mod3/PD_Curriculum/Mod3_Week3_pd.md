# Mod 3 Week 3: Outreach & Networking II
### Answer the below questions in a separate gist and link them into your career journal using this template:

Week 3:

- [x] (completed)
- [ ] (partially complete)
- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you’ll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track):

1. Back to your resume and cover letter you’ve been working on: What other next steps do you want to take to make these two components stronger?
- They need to have the same styling and right now they do not. 
   
2. Outreach Brainstorming: Either explore the company you wrote a cover letter for or find a new company to explore this week; Go to their company LinkedIn page and start to explore the employees. Who are a couple people you could reach out to? Why?
- Education Consultant: Since I have a background in education, I am able to easily apply terms of art. 
- Managers of Education Partnerships: Since I have a background in education, I am able to easily apply terms of art. 
- Manager of Front End Development: This is the field I am trying to enter.


3. Finalize Your Plan: Who have you decided to reach out to? Why that person? How will you contact them? What do you want to talk to them about? How will you follow up?
- I think I will reach out to a few people from the development team, one person from HR, and one Manager of Education Partnerships. Reaching out to HR and the Education Partnerships will not progress my career in development, but it will make my name relevant during the resume search. Sending messages to people in development will show that I am taking innitiative to learn about my work environment and will hopefully be a good chance for me to make a good first impression. 


4. Execute your plan: Reach out to your contact THIS WEEK. If possible, reach out to more than one person OR find a meetup to attend also. What happened? What did you learn about the company? What other next steps should you take for pursuing this company? Be sure to update this in Huntr.
- So far only one person has reached back. I think I will actually apply for this job though!
