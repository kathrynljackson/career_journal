### What do you think are the traits of a good software developer? What are they like in the workplace? What would you as a co-worker think of this person?

I think that a good software develper is focused, organized, and easy to communicate with. In the workplace, they would be someone that is dependable 
and easy to talk to about issues. As a coworker, I would think that this is an easy person to work with.



### What are the behaviors that this person demonstrates to embody the identity of a software developer? 

This person completes assigned tasks in a timely manner and listens to concerns before replying with an answer or reaction. 


### Who do you want to be as a software developer? What kind of behaviors do you already have in place to be that person? What behaviors would you need to put into place? How will you do that?

I would like to be known as someone who is dependable. This is a phrase that has been used to describe me in the past by my bosses, but being dependable has a different meaning in this field. Becuase of thise, it is important that I focus on my traits in terms of being a programmer. For instance, in education deadlines serve the purpose of letting teachers know when to reevaluate or reanalyze data. In programming, not reaching a deadline could potentially affect your coworkers and make their jobs harder. I have been trying to work on my skill of timeliness by putting everything into my calendar so I have all of my assigned tasks in one place. This makes it easier for me to plan out my day with an efficient schedule. 

### Bring self-awareness to your current habits by making a Habits Scorecard. Make a list of your daily habits (examples: wake up, turn off alarm, check phone, etc.) as a way to bring awareness to what you do. Then, decide how effective that habit is for you and your goal of becoming a software developer. Put a + next to habits that are effective; put a - next to habits that are not effective; put a = next to habits that are neutral.

* wake up
* turn off alarm
* +let the dogs outside
* =check social media
* +let the dogs inside
* +cuddle with dogs
* +alarm to get ready goes off
* +get dressed/ready
* go to computer and check slack
* make breakfast
* start class


### Pick 1 new habit you'd like to build and create an implementation intention following this template: "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]." Then, stack the habit onto something you already do: "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]." (Hint: make this highly specific and immediately actionable)

### Design your environment for success: what changes could you make in your space to better implement your habit? How could you remove any triggers for bad habits? How will you implement these changes?

### Respond after a few days of this implementation: What are your results? How do you feel about this method? How will you move forward with this habit?
