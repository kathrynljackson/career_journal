- [x] (completed)
- [ ] (partially complete)
- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you'll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track): 

1. Assess your habits from week 1: how did you spend your time this past week? What was effective in your habits? What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen?

Week 1 was quite easy for me compared to Mod 1. I am afraid that I'm becoming complacent and need to better implement my planned study habits. I need to create a consistent schedule and keep it whether I feel stressed or not. 

2. Write a draft of your professional story here as 1-2 paragraphs. Focus on answering the questions who are you, why are you here, and what's next? Consider how to talk about your motives and values, the turning points that led to your career change, and what you envision for yourself going forward?

As a teacher, I developed a love for technology. I became the school specialist for implementing technology in the classroom. I quickly realized that I enjoyed working with tech and wanted to learn more. After completing a year of my graduate degree in instructional design and technology, I realized that I didn't want to learn more about how use technology, I wanted to learn how to create it.

Becomming a programer has given me the opportunity to apply the skills that I already have. I am used to working under pressure and having to constantly think of solutions for the problems that others experience. As a developer, I hope to make the world of technology more accessible and useful for everyone. 

3. Update your LinkedIn profile with the following: updated photo/headshot, headline, summary statement using your story, and Turing added to your experience and education sections. Include a link to your profile here in the journal. Remember the guidelines and tips from the lesson here.

4. What other steps will you take this week to update your branding or practice your story?

I will begin trying to update my LinkedIn on a regular basis. By the time I am job hunting, I will have an impressive and useful page.
