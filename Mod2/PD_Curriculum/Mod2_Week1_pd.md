Week 1: 
- [x] (completed)
- [ ] (partially complete)
- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you'll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track): 

Ideas here are adapted from [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://bookshop.org/books/atomic-habits-an-easy-proven-way-to-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones/9780735211292)

1. Reflect on your habits from last module. What behaviors and activities were helpful for you? What activities and behaviors could be more effective for you? What processes would you like to try differently this module to become more effective at your work and as a software developer?

One habit that was helpful for me was using my calendar to record my upcoming dealines and meetings. I would like to find a study resource that works well for my learning style and attention span. I would like to find this resources and create a regular practice schedule as well as set study goals for each day or week.


2. Setting intentions for this module: who do I want to be this module? What specific habits would help me get there? How are those habits tied to the identity of a software developer?

This mod, I will be an SLC rep for my cohort. I want to be a good leader both in terms of being a resource and being a role model. I will be working on my communication skills, which will be a good skill for being a software developer. This is especially important because this mod will be a chance to use my communication skills remotely, which is a skill I will need in this specific field.

3. Incorporate [temptation bundling](https://jamesclear.com/temptation-bundling) to create a new habit by using this template:

* After I let my dogs out, I will get dressed and ready, then let the dogs back inside.
* After get dressed and let the dogs back inside, I will complete at least 15 minutes of coding practice.

4. How to enjoy “hard” habits: Reframe your habits to consider their benefits rather than their drawbacks; name 3 habits that you have to do and explain the benefits of them. How do they further your goals longterm? How will they add to your processes as a successful developer? At the end of the day, how do they add to your life?

* Set a minimum study goal for each day: As a developer, this habit well continue after I have a job. This will ensure that I stay up to date on best practices and continue to grow.
* Wake up at the same time during the school week: Starting my day at the same time will give me the same amount of time every morning to begin my day and complete habits before class. This will aide in consistency. 
* Set a hard stop goal: Stopping before a specific time allows for flexibility in the evening and forces me to give myself a mental health break before bed time. It will also ensure that I have enough time to get adequate sleep.

5. Environment design (optional 5-min. additional reading: [Motivation is Overvalued. Environment Often Matters More](https://jamesclear.com/power-of-environment)): how does your environment set-up currently help you with your habits? How could it be improved to make it easier for you to follow through on your habits?

My work environment is isolated from the rest of my home. It is always quiet and since I am the only one that uses the room, I have control over the tidiness and my schedule. Maintaining a cleaning schedule will keep the environment tidy and make me happy to be there.

6. “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” Read this [4-min article on how to stop procrastinating](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating). Apply the 2-minute rule to reframe 2-3 of your habits by scaling them down into the 2-minute version. How does this reframing help you think about shaping your new identity as a software developer?

I have a difficult time starting tasks due to ADHD. Setting a timer for when to just start would be a good way to give myself a chance to think about my task without overthinking the entire process. By setting this norm for myself, I will know what tactics work best for me when working from home.
