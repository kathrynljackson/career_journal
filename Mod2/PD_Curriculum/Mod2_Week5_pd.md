Answer the below questions in a separate gist and link them into your career journal using this template:

Week 5: 
- [x] (completed)
- [ ] (partially complete)
- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you'll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track): 

Review your habit tracker: how did you monitor your habit(s)? What does this tell you about your overall progress becoming the person you want to be? In general, how satisfied are you with how you spent your time this module? What could be improved next module?

Overall, I am proud of the progress I have made. I've definitely become better at self regulating practice and assignments that I find interesting. I need to improve in the areas of anything that does not peak my interests. Next mod, I want to keep up with professional development journals far better than I have in the past.

Mind Maps:

* i. Engagement. What did you reflect on last week in regards to when you're engaged in your work at Turing? Pull out an idea that resonates with you most (e.g., "Talking through a problem with a partner," "The moment when I solve a problem that I previously didn't know how to do," "Setting up a successful project management process for my team") and break that idea down into parts and make a list (what are all the steps that go into that moment? When do you get to use your strengths? What is fun about this?)

My engagement has become much better in the area of independent practice. Using Code Academy gives me the structure, assistance, and accountability I need to practice for small or long amounts of time. 

* ii. Energy. What did you reflect on last week in regards to when you feel most energized in your work at Turing? Pull out an idea that resonates with you most and break that idea down into parts and make a list (what are all the steps that go into that moment? When do you get to use your strengths? What is fun about this?).

Success:
* setting tiny goals
* practicing with others
* allowing myself to take breaks
* normalizing failure and repeated attempts.

* iii. Flow. When have you had an experience recently in which you were in a state of flow? You can also think about this as "joy" or "play." Pull out an idea that resonates with you most and break that idea down into parts and make a list (what are all the steps that go into that moment? When do you get to use your strengths? What is fun about this?).

Continuation:
* realizing that asking for help is also a form of advancement
* working in groups can be a good way to keep focus
* stopping doesn't necessarily stop flow. It simply allows me to continue without becoming so frustrated that I give up entirely or dread starting again, which could cause procrastination. 

Prototype your mind maps: what do these mind maps tell you about what's important to you as a software developer? What questions do they bring up about what you still want to learn about this career?

Prototype your outreach: (Be prepared to share this in your small group discussion)
> What different non-tech fields can I work in that require programmers?
> What is the turn over rate?
> How easy is it to get a job without a degree?

* Who comes to mind as a person you can reach out to? Why that person? What questions would you ask them? Come up with 2-3 people here to serve as prototypes.

> Nate - a friend from college that owns a debt repayment app.I would want to ask him how he started and how long it took him from beginning to plan all the way to launch day.
> Roxana Cristea - She was one of the professionals that we met during the professional development session. We have connected on LinkedIn and I would love to ask her about hoe she started looking for jobs and what gender-specific considerations she applied to her initial job search. 

* How would this outreach help you further your job search strategy?

Since I don't know much about the field as a whole, these questions would give me insight on which I can form my expectations. 

Outreach & Networking Plan: Based on your reflections above, create a concrete plan for your outreach:

* Who is the right person for you to reach out to?
> Roxana Cristea
* How will you find them? How do you know theyâ€™re the right person?
> We are connected on LinkedIn. She has many years of experience in the field.
* How will you reach out?
> I will send a message. She lives in a different time zone so this will be the most considerate mode of communication. 
* What questions do you need to ask them?
> What considerations should I apply to my current job search?
* How will you use this information to further your solution?
> The answer will be be narrow down the companies I want to work for and what paramters ti apply to the filters. 
* How will you follow up?
> I will be sure to thank her throughout my process. 

Execute your plan:

* Reach out to your contact THIS WEEK. If possible, reach out to more than one person OR find a meetup to attend also. What happened? What other next steps should you take? If this is a person connected to a company you're interested in, be sure to add it to your Huntr card.

I reached out to thank her for taking her time to speak with us during the session. She responded letting me know that she is open to further contact. I am excited to have a new connection in this field, since I do not have many outside of turing.
