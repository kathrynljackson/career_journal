## 1. When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for 
you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?

Whenever I work towards a goal, I focus on the logical reasoning as to why I should complete the goal. If it is a **want**, 
working towards the goal comes naturally. If the goal involves a **need**, then there's a chance that the process
will not be fun. In cases like these, I remind myself why I logically need to complete that goal.
