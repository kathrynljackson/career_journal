## Message from Casey

First, here are two things I saw that I appreciated in your project - keep this up!:

* Awesome use of the array prototype push!!

* Great job using conditionals in the warm-up.js to really own that control flow.

Second, here is one area I saw that you can grow in:

* Get rid of console.log in your code. It is not needed and makes code a bit messier.

Here are two technical things to get some extra practice on (perhaps work on these concepts with a mentor!):

* Getting a more concrete understanding of testing and writing code to satisfy tests. Go over the first half of the testing of that testing lesson again, work through the functions repo here. Continue to work on these tests with other folks and then delete the code and do them again.

* Arguments and parameters. Spend some time looking at what the test is asking for, how the tests calls a function and if that function is getting called with data inside of it. Spend some time console logging the parameters inside of your function definition to see how the data moves from the function invocation in the test, to the function's code block in your js file.

And I would like two deliverables from you - please reflect on the following questions and send me a few thoughts on each:

* When you got stuck, what did you do? What, looking back, could you have done differently?

* What prevented you from trying out those different things?

* What kind of support from the instructors would help you get past the fears/blockers/embarrassment/anxiety that held you back from trying those different strategies when you got stuck?
