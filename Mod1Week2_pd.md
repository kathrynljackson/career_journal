## Think of a couple of pieces of feedback in the recent past that you found tough to receive. What were the most immediate thoughts to go through your mind as you received this feedback?


The last piece of feedback that I received that I found hard to receive was when my boss/principal told me that my lack of 
collaboration was preventing me from being the best teacher that I could be. At first I felt like I was being told that I needed
to be better at my job, but as I continued to listen I realized that the feedback, tone, and timing all served the purpose 
of encouraging me to use a skill I wasn't using to make me a better colleague and teacher.
