## Week 1


### What is something you have learned to do well (list a skill)?

I have learned how to cook new food thanks to extra spare time during quarantine. While I was taught how to cook when I was young, I wasn't exposed to a great variety of food. I love that technology allows me to research new recipes and to reach out to friends from different cultures than my own. 


### What is something you know about (list some knowledge/expertise you have)?

I have a few special interests that I know a lot about and enjoy researching, the two most prominent being animals and comic book characters. I also have a professional level of knowledge in the field of education since I was a teacher for six years. 


### What is something you have a natural ability to do well (list a talent)?



### How do those combine to create a specific strength?
