- [ ] (completed)
- [ ] (partially complete)
- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you’ll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track):

1. Taking stock of where you are: what have you accomplished this module? What have you learned? Where are you stuck (have you not been able to follow through on outreach? Is your resume not finished?)?

2. Create plans for 3 different companies you want to target:
 - Questions to reflect on here: Why do you like this company? What makes you want to work there? Why are you a good fit for this company? What do you bring to the company? What transferable skills do you have? What do you already know about the company (product, team, culture, company size, location, etc.)? What do you need to learn?
 - Steps to take:
  
    - Outreach: look at the company’s LinkedIn page: who could you reach out to? What questions do you want to ask that person?
    - Experience: once you’ve made a connection at the company, how could you find out more? Consider setting up a job shadow or exploring their tech stack in your projects
- Read back over the plan. How does it reflect your vision?
- Imagine that you get the job. A year later, what have you gained from this experience? How have you started to fulfill your vision?

### Plan
   
- Plan #1:

- Plan #2:

- Plan #3:

1. Make it actionable: rank each plan on a scale of 1-5 for how much your plan aligns with the following:
   - Available resources to help you pursue it: contacts, time, knowledge of the company, etc.
   - Coherence: how it aligns with your career vision
   - Confidence level: how feasible does this feel to you?
   - How excited you are about it?
Now, pick the plan with the highest numbers across the board. What steps will you take next to pursue this strategy as you go into the next module?
