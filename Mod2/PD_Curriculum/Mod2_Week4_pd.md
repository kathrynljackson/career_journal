Week 4: 
- [x] (completed)
- [ ] (partially complete)
- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you'll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track): 

In week 4, you'll have a job experience activity with employers. The next two prompts are designed to help you both prepare and reflect on that experience: 
1. Prepare for Job Experience: AEIOU
* Activities: what questions do you have about the activities that a software developer does on a daily basis?
> What is your schedule like?
> Do you still practice coding?
* Environment: what questions do you have about the overall environment and culture of this workplace?
> Do you work remotely, in person, or a combination of the two?
* Interactions: what questions do you have about the team at this company? What do you hope to learn during this experience?
> How many people do you work with on a daily basis?
> How many people do you work with on a weekly basis?
* Objects: what questions do you have about the code or the product?
> Why was this company founded?
> How does the the company's current value compare to values it was founded on?
* Users: what questions do you have about how the company interacts with their users?
> How does the company accept and fix problems that clients communicate?

2. After the Job Experience, reflect on the same questions; what are your takeaways from the activity? 
* Activities: what was engaging to the person/people you met with?
> They enjoyed being a programmer and were eager to share their experience and knowledge.
* Environment: what did you notice about how they talked about the culture and environment of this company?
> They were proud to work for the company and shared how it compared to their past jobs in terms of how employees were treated and how the company interacted with the public.
* Interactions: what did you notice about your interactions with this person/people?
> They were honest, but polite. 
* Objects: what did you learn about their approach to code and/or product development?
> While I didn't find this particular company interesting, I loved learning about it.
* Users: what did you learn about their approach to their users?
> Not much, but I learned a lot about how they all interact with each other.
* What are your main takeaways from the shadow? How will you use this information to help you with your job search strategy?
> My main takeaways were that I finally have a reference for what type of company I want to work for. 

Ideas below are adapted from [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://bookshop.org/books/atomic-habits-an-easy-proven-way-to-build-good-habits-break-bad-ones/9780735211292)

3. Assess your habits from week 3: how did you spend your time this past week? What was effective in your habits? What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen?

I spent most of my spare time working on the group project. Because of this, I did not keep up with the practice goals I set for myself. I think I want to ensure that I always have practice time in the morning since most peers don't want to meet at that time.

4. Implement a reiforcement strategy: to make one of your habits more satisfying, what is a reward you can give yourself immediately after completing the habit? How will this reward encourage you to continue completing that habit?

I will reward myself by giving my dogs a snack after I complete my practice time. As silly as it seems, I will never want to deny a treat for my pups and it will feel more rewarding for me than rewarding myself.

5. "Don't Break the Chain": Use a habit tracker

* What is a habit that you want to make sure to do every day? How could you visually cue yourself to complete it (i.e., moving a paper clip)? How can you visually track it each time you've completed it? Could you automate the tracking? How will you do that?

Code academy automatically keeps track of both my progress and study times. I need to check the stats daily to make sure that I am making the proper progress according to both my personal goals and the school curriculum. 

6. How to get back on track when missing a habit: if you miss a day or two of completing your habit, how will you get yourself going again?

I focus more on progress than on daily patterns, so missing a day does not throw me off as it does many people. 

7. Pick an accountability partner (your cohort accountabilibuddy, your mentor, a close friend, etc.) and create a habit contract with them. How often will you check in with each other? How will they hold you accountable?

My partner also works in technology and knows that is expected of me in the field. For this reason, it will be difficult for me to be lazy or become complacent.
