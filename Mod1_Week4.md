### Mod 1 Week 4: Creating Your Vision, Part I <a name="week-4"></a>
1. Habits Reflection:
* How have you seen yourself become more aware of your habits? Have you tried implementing anything new? What have the results been? 

2. Start Where You Are (Empathize with the user -- *you*)
* Health: how you answer “how are you”; intersection of physical, mental, and emotional health
    * How would you rate your overall health on a scale of 1-5? How do you currently make time for activities associated with your health? What is a small change you could make here to readjust your health ratings?
    
*I would rate my health as a 4 due to chronic health conditions. I make time for my health by scheduling my appointments and planning out nutritious meals in advance. Consistency is the beast way that I can personally continue to increase my health ratings.* 
    
* Work: what you do
    * Make a short list of all the ways you work right now; How much value do each of those things bring to your life? How are those activities purposeful for you?
    
*Turing classes are most of what I do for work. I also take care of my animals. Both of these things bring me joy in different ways. Turing gives me a sense of accomplishment, while my animals give me a sense of peace.*
    
* Play: what brings you joy? Think about joy just for the pure sake of doing it; everyone benefits from this kind of play 
    * What activities do you do that bring you joy throughout an average week? In what ways could you make a small change to bring more joy into your life?
*Reading, playing video games, talking to my friends online, and spending time with my partner makes me happy. I need to schedule my work time better to maximize my leisure time. 
    
* Love: sense of connection; who are the people who matter in your life and how is love flowing to and from you and them?
    * How does love currently show up in your life? How do you show love to others right now? What adjustments would you like to make in this area?
    
* Looking back at the 4 areas, do any problems emerge that you want to begin designing solutions for?

3. Define your needs, problem, and insights:

Based on what you wrote about above and your group conversation, what problems have you identified that you'd like to design solutions for? What do you already about what you want for your career? What do you still need to find out? Who or what do you want to grow into by the end of the Turing program? 

4.  Ideate -- challenge assumptions   

When you discussed software developers with your small group on Monday, what assumptions came up about what software developers actually do? What steps could you take to challenge those assumptions and find more facts to answer the question of what developers do? In addition to what a typical software developer life could look like, what do you want yours to include?

5. Prototype -- start creating solutions

What is the basic threshold that your new career must meet after Turing? What would you hope WILL NOT happen in your future after Turing? What is your absolute, no-holds-barred, ideal dream for your future after Turing?

6. Test –- solutions

Based on this week of reflections, write out your initial vision statement for your career:

### Small Group Discussion Notes

Curiosity: what does a software developer actually do? What do you already know? What else do you need to find out? How could you do that?

*coding, developing software, problem solving; talking to mentors, build a network*

Bias to action: what step will you try out first to find out more? 

*using the networking opportunities, (all hands), saving resources* 

Radical collaboration: share one of the problems you identified in your earlier journal reflection when it comes to health/work/play/love; use this as an opportunity to vet solutions from your group -- “how might you tackle this problem?”
* Group members: opportunity to empathize with the user to think about solutions

*consistency, site blockers, scheduling*
