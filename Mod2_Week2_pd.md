## Journal Activity:
Reflect on how youâ€™ve spent your time thus far at Turing to gauge your engagement and energy:

**When have you been excited, focused, and enjoyed your work?**

I get most excited when I feel like I am making measureable progress.

**When have you felt bored, restless, or unhappy?**

I tend to get bored when I'm either not performing an action or when the content being taught is currently too hard for me to mentally apply to my background knowledge. 

**When do you feel energized in your work?**

I feel energized when there is success based on my effort, understanding, or deliverable work.

**When is your energy drained?**

My energy is drained when I spend a lot of time and make no progress.

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you'll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track): 

1. Assess your habits from week 1: how did you spend your time this past week? What was effective in your habits? What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen?

2. Write a draft of your professional story here as 1-2 paragraphs. Focus on answering the questions who are you, why are you here, and what's next? Consider how to talk about your motives and values, the turning points that led to your career change, and what you envision for yourself going forward.

3. Update your LinkedIn profile with the following: updated photo/headshot, headline, summary statement using your story, and Turing added to your experience and education sections. Include a link to your profile here in the journal. Remember the guidelines and tips from the lesson here.

4. What other steps will you take this week to update your branding or practice your story?
