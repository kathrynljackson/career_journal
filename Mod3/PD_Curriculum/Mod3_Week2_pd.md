Week 2: [Link here to your gist]

- [ ] (completed)

- [ ] (partially complete)

- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you’ll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track):

1. Find a position or use a position you’ve put on your Huntr board and write a cover letter for that position in a Google doc or gist. Reference these cover letter resources as well as the session to complete your cover letter.
Post the link to your cover letter here
2. Review your cover letter with a peer some time this week. What feedback did your partner give you? What next steps will you take to make your cover letter even stronger?
3. If you were to apply to this position (and you should!), how will you customize your resume for it? What other next steps would you need to take here?
