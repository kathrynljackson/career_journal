## Message from Casey

First, here are two things I saw that I appreciated in your project - keep this up!:

* Awesome use of the array prototype push!!

* Great job using conditionals in the warm-up.js to really own that control flow.

Second, here is one area I saw that you can grow in:

* Get rid of console.log in your code. It is not needed and makes code a bit messier.

Here are two technical things to get some extra practice on (perhaps work on these concepts with a mentor!):

* Getting a more concrete understanding of testing and writing code to satisfy tests. Go over the first half of the testing of that testing lesson again, work through the functions repo here. Continue to work on these tests with other folks and then delete the code and do them again.

* Arguments and parameters. Spend some time looking at what the test is asking for, how the tests calls a function and if that function is getting called with data inside of it. Spend some time console logging the parameters inside of your function definition to see how the data moves from the function invocation in the test, to the function's code block in your js file.

And I would like two deliverables from you - please reflect on the following questions and send me a few thoughts on each:

**When you got stuck, what did you do? What, looking back, could you have done differently?**

When I got stuck I began using Google to look up how testing works. While I took notes and paid attention, this was just a concept that I needed more help on. The videos I found were not helpful, and I should have reached out on Slack and asked for the specific help that I needed. 

**What prevented you from trying out those different things?**

I am very used to having to figure out problems on my own. I am also very introverted. Because of this, I did not consider getting help until a classmate asked how I was doing with the project. Orlando immediately offered to help me and walked me through the testing process. He even stayed on to make sure that I could do it on my own. As ridiculous as it is, that is why I am starting to feel more comfortable with reaching out for help. Reaching out is going to make me a better coder and then maybe I can implement my skills as a teacher to help others in the future. 

**What kind of support from the instructors would help you get past the fears/blockers/embarrassment/anxiety that held you back from trying those different strategies when you got stuck?**

I come from a field where standards of efficiency are pretty cut and dry. However, Turing works based on progress and effort. As an educator, I love how the learning and assessment system works for Turing. But as someone with autism, I appreciate and need feedback that I can tie to concrete tasks. For instance, Scott recently sent me a message that lists specific skills that I need to work on during my practice time. I can now take these back to my mentor or study group and focus specifically on them, ensuring that I am progressing in the areas that I need for my individual understanding. Knowing what is expected of me and when it is expected helps ease my anxiety since I know whether something needs to be done or what part of a process I should be in, whether it be to understand learning goals or to complete a task. Overall, I think that the way the instructors communicate works well for me. I am still getting adjusted to being in a new field, so I'm not sure what support I need yet. This is something that I will bring up with John Adams during our session this week.
