# Mod 3 Week 5: Refining Your Strategy
### Answer the below questions in a separate gist and link them into your career journal using this template:

Week 5:

- [x] (completed)
- [ ] (partially complete)
- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you’ll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track):

1. Taking stock of where you are: what have you accomplished this module? What have you learned? Where are you stuck (have you not been able to follow through on outreach? Is your resume not finished?)?
- My resume is complete but I want more developers to read it. I might reach out to my instructors and mentors for more feedback. 
- I have learned that I am more prepared technically than I thought I was to become a developer. 
- I don't feel stuck in any area yet. 

2. Create plans for 3 different companies you want to target:
 - Questions to reflect on here: Why do you like this company? What makes you want to work there? Why are you a good fit for this company? What do you bring to the company? What transferable skills do you have? What do you already know about the company (product, team, culture, company size, location, etc.)? What do you need to learn?
 - Steps to take:
  
    - Outreach: look at the company’s LinkedIn page: who could you reach out to? What questions do you want to ask that person?
    - Experience: once you’ve made a connection at the company, how could you find out more? Consider setting up a job shadow or exploring their tech stack in your projects
- Read back over the plan. How does it reflect your vision?
- Imagine that you get the job. A year later, what have you gained from this experience? How have you started to fulfill your vision?

### Plan
   
- Plan #1: Discovery Education
   - Get my resume revised by mentor
   - Continue to reach out
   - Practice using terms of art for the interview so I can combine them with my knowledge about the field of education while still ounding equally comfortable in both fields. 
   - Apply

- Plan #2: Qoins
   - Reach out to my high school friend that started the company
   - Research the company to deicde whether or not I'll even like it. 
   - Learn about the jobs that are done at this company
   - Apply

- Plan #3: University (any local)
   - Research what local universities are hiring junior developers. This would be a good choice in case I want to continue my higher education. 
   - Continue to practice for tech interviews. 

1. Make it actionable: rank each plan on a scale of 1-5 for how much your plan aligns with the following:
   - Available resources to help you pursue it: contacts, time, knowledge of the company, etc.
   - Coherence: how it aligns with your career vision
   - Confidence level: how feasible does this feel to you?
   - How excited you are about it?
Now, pick the plan with the highest numbers across the board. What steps will you take next to pursue this strategy as you go into the next module?
- Discovery educatin is the easiest for me to apply for. My first step is to send my resume to people for revisions and feedback. Next I will continue to practice technical skills. Then I will apply. Professionally, I feel comfortable interviewing for this position, but I need more time to be ready as far as developer skills go.
