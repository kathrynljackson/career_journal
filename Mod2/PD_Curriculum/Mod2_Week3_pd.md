## Week 3: [Link here to your gist](https://github.com/kathrynljackson/career_journal/blob/master/Mod2_Week3_pd.md)
- [x] (completed)
- [ ] (partially complete)
- [ ] (not started)

If you will not be able to complete your journal this week, please provide an update for the Career Dev team on when you'll have it completed here (remember to reflect on what you have control over, what you want to try differently this week, and what habits you can utilize to get back on track): 


### 1. Assess your habits from week 2: how did you spend your time this past week? What was effective in your habits? What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen?

I have found that using Code Academy is a very helpful study tool. I can easy use it in bed while watching tv and even have it on my phone for when I'm waiting in line or relaxing. Keeping this practice consistent will make the habits more effective and I plan on making this my main mode of practice. 

### 2. Reflect on how youâ€™ve spent your time so far at Turing to gauge your engagement and energy:

**When have you been excited, focused, and enjoyed your work?**

I get most excited when I feel like I am making measureable progress.

**When have you felt bored, restless, or unhappy?**

I tend to get bored when I'm either not performing an action or when the content being taught is currently too hard for me to mentally apply to my background knowledge. 

**When do you feel energized in your work?**

I feel energized when there is success based on my effort, understanding, or deliverable work.

**When is your energy drained?**

My energy is drained when I spend a lot of time and make no progress.

### 3. Setting up habits and routines to make time for the job search this module:

* Block out time on your calendar this week to work on your job search. When will you make this happen? How will you hold yourself accountable to this? What activities will you focus on during this time this week? What outcomes do you hope to reach by the end of this week because of these activities?

Tonight at 7pm I will begin a job search for the purpose of learning what I want to look for in a job. This will give me a good reference point for my standards on location, assigned work time, and salary. I will hold myself accountable by telling my partner and asking them to discuss what I've learned about the field every day.

### 4. Applying wayfinding to using job search resources

* Go through the resources [listed here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum-site/blob/master/resources/finding_opportunities.md) and explore 2-3 tools. List what you looked at here:
 
 > Tech Ladies
 > LinkedIn

* Apply wayfinding: of what you looked at, what did you discover that aligns with your vision? If it didn't align with your vision, what will you try next? Decide what tools to bookmark to explore later. 

> Tech ladies is great for resources and job opportunities that I know are both safe and trustworthy. I will continue to use this resource even after the job hunt. 

> This was my first time using LinkedIn to search for jobs. I was surprised at how much easier it was to use than searching for jobs on google. I like that many of the opportunities take the LinkedIn profile instead of the traditional paper or sent resume. By viewing the profile, they can see other aspects like my connections, my personality, and what others that have worked with me think of the experience of working with me. 

* Find a job posting that aligns with your vision. What's the posting? How does it align with what you're looking for? Add it to your Huntr.

There is a job posting for Reed Global that matched my profile. I like that it is remote and looking for entry level programmers. 

* What next steps will you take to explore that opportunity and find contacts? Add that information to your Huntr card.

I plan on researching the company by continuing to look at their websites. Next, I will explore their social media to get a feel of their public presence and political stances.
