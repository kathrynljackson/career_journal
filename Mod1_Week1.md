## What is your understanding of unconscious bias?

My understanding of unconscious is described as a preconcieved notion that unknowingly affects a group of people.

## How does this connect to your experiences: “If you aren’t conscious of the biases that you have, you’re just not contributing at the level you could, and you’re not innovating at the level that you could, and so your products won’t be as good.”

This makes a lot of sense to me. I often have to explain this concept to people when it comes to racism in America. This shows me that bias comes in many forms and affects different aspects of life for different people.


## Once a person becomes aware of their biases what actions could be taken to change their biases?
The next step is to learn what affects your biases have, then they should make changes to their thinking and behavior to eliminate their negative effects.
